## KaliWeaver
KaliWeaver is a generative music‑prompt engine that weaves structure, chaos, 
and ritual energy into Suno‑ready prompts. Built in F#, it transforms 
high‑level musical intent into detailed sections, textures, and lyrical 
concepts — blending glitch, aggression, and mythic atmosphere into a single 
creative flow.
